1. no way to easily operate with boxes the same as value

let x: MaybeRBoxed<number> = ...
tag({ 
	className: { 
		// CRINGE
		disabled: isRBox(x)? x.map(someAction): someAction(x) 
	}
})

2. no way to robustly typecheck what's inside the boxes

let x: MaybeRBoxed<string | number> = ...
if(???){
	console.log("this is number!", x() * 2)
}

(is it a problem though? even if the box have one value or another NOW - it does not mean it cannot get another value later. so yes, this problem is not solvable by design)
